# EM paradata export rendering — design

Date: 2026-06-08
Branch: `Stratigraph_00001`
Status: design approved, ready for implementation plan

## Problem

When a pyArchInit site is exported to GraphML (`export_graphml` →
`GraphProjector.populate_graph` → s3dgraphy `GraphMLExporter`) for yEd /
EM-tools, the Extended-Matrix paradata and contemporaneity relations do not
render the way the EM convention requires. Concretely, on the `Sito_Test_EM`
test database the exported `.graphml` shows:

1. **Paradata (DOC / Extractor / Combinar / property) appear disconnected.**
   The s3dgraphy `GraphMLExporter` excludes `PARADATA_EDGE_TYPES` from the drawn
   edges (`graphml_exporter.py` ~line 253: `export_edges = [e for e in
   self.graph.edges if e.edge_type not in TOPOLOGICAL_EDGE_TYPES and
   e.edge_type not in PARADATA_EDGE_TYPES]`) and renders paradata as group
   folders instead. The data-flow chain
   (`DOC → Extractor → Combinar → property → US/USV`) is invisible.
2. **Continuity (CON) nodes are missing.** Rows with `unita_tipo='CON'`
   (`ContinuityNode`, `node_type='BR'`) are not rendered as nodes in the export
   (`CON present: []`), so the user's explicitly-authored continuity is lost.
   (Separate from the *auto* `_synth_BR_*` diamonds, already suppressed in
   `[5.12.10-alpha]`.)
3. **Contemporaneity edges look like ordinary directed edges.**
   `is_physically_equal_to` ("Uguale a") and `is_bonded_to` ("Si lega a")
   currently render as a solid line **with** an arrowhead
   (`edge_generator.py`: `('line', 2.0)` + `Arrows target='standard'`). The EM
   convention is a **double line with no arrowhead**, and the two contemporary
   nodes must sit on the **same horizontal line**.
4. **Paradata node labels show the description, not the us code.** DOC /
   Combinar / Extractor / property render as `Documento` / `Combiner` /
   `Extractor` / `Proprieta` (from `d_stratigrafica`) instead of the `us` value
   (`D.1`, `C.1`, `D.1.1`, `prop1`). Source: `graphml_writer._resolve_display_label`
   returns `descrizione` for these unita_tipo.

These are rendering concerns in the s3dgraphy `GraphMLExporter` /
`edge_generator` plus one label concern in pyArchInit's `graphml_writer`. The
in-memory graph produced by `populate_graph` is already correct (paradata edges
typed by `paradata_edge_resolver`, USV/SF connected — `[5.12.9-alpha]`); the gap
is purely in how the GraphML is *written*.

## Goals

A pyArchInit → GraphML export whose paradata and contemporaneity render per the
EM/yEd convention:

- Paradata are **connected nodes** with the EM edges visible:
  `extracted_from`, `combines`, `has_property`, `has_documentation`,
  `has_data_provenance` (NOT folder-grouped, NOT filtered out).
- Paradata node labels are the **`us` value** (`D.1`, `D.1.1`, `C.1`, `prop1`).
- Contemporaneity edges (`is_physically_equal_to`, `is_bonded_to`, and the
  canonical `equals` / `bonded_to`) render as **double line, no arrowhead**;
  same-line alignment is delegated to yEd's layout (a non-directional edge).
- Explicit **CON** (`ContinuityNode`/BR) rows render as **diamond** nodes
  connected by `is_after` (the `>` / `<` shorthand).

Every fix is verified on the test DB via headless `export_graphml`, asserting on
the produced XML — not just on the in-memory graph.

## Approach (C — hybrid)

| # | Fix | Component | Location | Durability |
|---|-----|-----------|----------|------------|
| 4 | Paradata label = `us` | pyArchInit `graphml_writer._resolve_display_label` | `modules/s3dgraphy/sync/graphml_writer.py` | committed (durable) |
| 1 | Draw paradata edges | s3dgraphy `GraphMLExporter` | `ext_libs/s3dgraphy/exporter/graphml/graphml_exporter.py` | ext_libs live + fork PR |
| 3 | Contemporaneity double-line/no-arrow | s3dgraphy `edge_generator` | `ext_libs/s3dgraphy/exporter/graphml/edge_generator.py` | ext_libs live + fork PR |
| 2 | Render CON nodes | s3dgraphy `GraphMLExporter` | `ext_libs/s3dgraphy/exporter/graphml/graphml_exporter.py` | ext_libs live + fork PR |

The s3dgraphy-core fixes (1/2/3) are applied to `ext_libs` for the live result
and committed to the fork (branch `fix/pyarchinit-importer-node-type-by-unita-tipo`,
or a dedicated `fix/em-paradata-export-rendering` branch) for the upstream PR —
matching the established "live stop-gap + fork PR" pattern (dev9, #22/#23).
`ext_libs` is git-ignored: re-vendoring wipes the live patches until the PR is
merged and a dev release is pinned. pyArchInit-side callers must degrade
gracefully (no crash) if a re-vendored `ext_libs` lacks a change.

## Components

### Component 1 — Paradata label = `us` (fix #4)

`modules/s3dgraphy/sync/graphml_writer.py :: _resolve_display_label`.

Current: for `DOC` / `EXT` / `Extractor` / `Combinar` / `property` it returns
`descrizione.strip()` (the `d_stratigrafica` value) before falling back to a
`us`-derived form. Target: return the **`us` value** for these kinds:

- `DOC` → `us` (e.g. `D.1`)
- `Extractor` (and legacy `EXT`) → `us` (e.g. `D.1.1`)
- `Combinar` → `us` (e.g. `C.1`)
- `property` → `us` (e.g. `prop1`)

US / USM / USV* / SF / VSF / CON branches are unchanged (already correct after
the `[5.12.9-alpha]` / SF-VSF-naming test-data fix). Keep a sane fallback when
`us` is empty.

Test: headless export of the test DB → the DOC node's `NodeLabel` text == `D.1`
(and `D.1.1` / `C.1` / `prop1` for the others); no node labelled `Documento` /
`Combiner` / `Extractor` / `Proprieta`.

### Component 2 — Draw paradata edges (fix #1)

`ext_libs/s3dgraphy/exporter/graphml/graphml_exporter.py` (export-edge
selection, ~line 253) + the paradata-group rendering.

Current: `export_edges` excludes `PARADATA_EDGE_TYPES`; paradata are rendered as
`has_paradata_nodegroup` folders. Target: the paradata edges
(`extracted_from`, `combines`, `has_property`, `has_documentation`,
`has_data_provenance`) are **kept in `export_edges`** and drawn as visible
edges, and the folder grouping for these paradata is **not** applied (per the
approved "archi visibili" choice). `edge_generator` already styles
`extracted_from` as dashed; the remaining paradata edge types need a style entry
(default acceptable, dashed preferred for provenance-family).

**Decided**: gate the paradata-group code path behind a flag
`paradata_as_groups: bool = True` on `GraphMLExporter.export()`. Upstream
default stays `True` (folders — non-destructive for other consumers). The
pyArchInit export call passes `paradata_as_groups=False`, which keeps the
paradata edges in `export_edges` (drawn as visible edges) and skips the folder
rendering. `graphml_writer` passes the flag defensively via `inspect.signature`
(same pattern as `continuity_diamonds`), so a re-vendored `ext_libs` without the
param falls back to the default rather than crashing.

Test: headless export → `extracted_from` / `combines` / `has_property` /
`has_documentation` present as `<edge>` elements; Combiner / Extractor / property
nodes are NOT isolated (degree ≥ 1).

### Component 3 — Contemporaneity edge style (fix #3)

`ext_libs/s3dgraphy/exporter/graphml/edge_generator.py`.

Current: `is_bonded_to` / `is_physically_equal_to` → `('line', 2.0)`, and
`generate_edge` always sets `Arrows target='standard'`. Target: for the
contemporaneity edge types (`is_physically_equal_to`, `is_bonded_to`, and the
canonical aliases `equals`, `bonded_to`, plus `has_same_time`):

- **No arrowhead**: `Arrows source='none' target='none'`.
- **Double line = two parallel edges** (DECIDED). The exporter emits **two**
  `<edge>` elements between the same source/target for each contemporaneity
  relation, each with no arrowhead, so yEd renders two parallel arcs (the EM
  contemporaneity convention). Give the two edges distinct edge ids and small
  opposite bend offsets so they don't overlap into a single line.

Same-line placement is **not** forced by the exporter — it is achieved when the
user applies the yEd layout, because a no-arrow edge is treated as
non-directional (same rank).

Test: headless export → for each contemporaneity relation there are **two**
`<edge>` elements between the same endpoints, both with `Arrows source='none'
target='none'`.

### Component 4 — Render CON nodes (fix #2)

`ext_libs/s3dgraphy/exporter/graphml/graphml_exporter.py` (node rendering).

Current: explicit `ContinuityNode` (`node_type='BR'`) rows are not emitted as
nodes (`CON present: []`). Target: render them as the EM **continuity diamond**
(the BR SVG already exists in `canvas_generator._get_continuity_svg`) and draw
their `is_after` edges (`>` / `<`). The drop point in the exporter's
node-rendering loop must be located in the plan and the BR type allowed through
for *non-synthetic* (user-authored, `injected_by` absent) continuity nodes. This
is distinct from the auto `_synth_BR_*` diamonds suppressed in `[5.12.10-alpha]`
— those stay suppressed; explicit CON rows are rendered.

Test: headless export → `CON1` / `CON2` nodes present (diamond shape) + their
`is_after` edges to `USM6` / `USM8`.

## Testing strategy

- A headless test (pattern of the existing `tests/sync` ones) that runs
  `export_graphml` on the `Sito_Test_EM` test DB (or a small hermetic fixture)
  and parses the produced `.graphml`, asserting the four outcomes above.
- For the s3dgraphy-core changes, add unit tests in the fork (the PR) covering:
  paradata edges drawn, contemporaneity no-arrow style, CON node emitted.
- Run the full `tests/sync` suite (baseline: 415 passed, 9 fail + 9 err
  pre-existing PG/Spatialite) — zero new regressions, AC-2 export baselines
  unchanged for fixtures without paradata/contemporaneity.

## Out of scope

- The 5 residual `generic_connection` edges (SF/VSF/USM ↔ USVs): no datamodel
  edge type applies — correct as-is.
- The s3dgraphy **importer** typing fix (fork branch
  `fix/pyarchinit-importer-node-type-by-unita-tipo`): a separate valid upstream
  improvement, not required for the pyArchInit export (which uses the bridge
  `StratigraphicUnit` + `unita_tipo` nodes).
- A pyArchInit config toggle to re-enable folder-based paradata / continuity
  diamonds — only add if a future user needs it.

## Risks / notes

- **ext_libs durability**: components 1–3 (and 4) live in `ext_libs` until the
  upstream PR lands; re-vendoring wipes them. pyArchInit callers stay defensive
  (both `continuity_diamonds` and `paradata_as_groups` are passed via
  `inspect.signature` detection).
- **EM-tools round-trip**: switching paradata from folders to visible edges may
  affect how EM-tools (Blender) re-imports the GraphML. Validate with the user's
  EM-tools workflow before merging the upstream PR.
